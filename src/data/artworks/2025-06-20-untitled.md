## Statement

This is the statement.
The artwork explores themes of texture and repetition through traditional printmaking techniques. Each impression builds upon the last, creating a layered composition that invites closer inspection.

## Process

- Initial sketches developed in charcoal
- Transfer to linoleum block for carving
- Multiple color passes using reduction method
- Final edition of 15 signed prints
