The combined performance of Megan Tatiana Convey Gómez & Yasaman Moussavi on 2/1/2020 at the Beverly Arts Center performed in memory of both the victims of Hurricane Maria and those who lost their lives in the recent passenger plane shut down in Iran.

Between Moussavi & Convey Gómez, they will complete 176 Sun Salutation (a traditional yoga sequence), to honor each person who has lost their life on the plane crash. Yasaman Moussavi created 176 screen print card, number of people who past away in Plane shut down, and distributed them to audiences.
