This project, which took place in 2022-23, sought to enhance environmental consciousness and promote unity in the community through collaborative art-making. Participants collaborated to transform waste materials, such as newspapers, magazines, and letters, into art, sparking discussions on environmental matters in the process. The project offered a hands-on creative experience and fostered community development. The collective artworks were then assembled into an art installation, which was displayed in the common area of the University neighborhood cultural center.
