## Statement
In this series of work, I have incorporated the struggle of identity into my creative process and my medium selection. As a material source, I recycle the mailed dries plants, “roots” from my family garden in Iran in combination with the locally found materials, such as dried leaves and plant seeds, in the vicinity of where I live in Chicago. These explorations in the material and the process of papermaking fascinates me as a site of investigating the sense of place in disassembling and reassembling memories and expressing the transitional stages in life.
