During my sixth-month artist residency with the AIRS program at Douglas Elementary in Vancouver, BC, I worked with grades 2-4 students to explore the transformative art of papermaking. Students learned to recycle paper from their own school, discovering techniques in making paper, adding natural materials such as leaves, drawing with materials such as yarn and threads, painting with dyed pulp, and creating textures with various materials. Students developed tactile awareness and artistic expression through twelve focused sessions while learning about environmental impact. The process emphasized patience, teamwork, and sustainability as students transformed waste paper into handmade art. Students practiced attunement and careful observation, engaging with materials through touch and creative exploration. Each session built their understanding of texture, material properties, and emotional expression through hands-on learning. This journey culminates in a site-specific installation at the Vancouver School Board in May 2024, showcasing their artistic exploration and environmental consciousness through transformed paperwork.
