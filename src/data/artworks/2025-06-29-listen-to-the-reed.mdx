## Statement

This body of work is inspired by the literary poems written by famous Persian poets; Molana Jalal ed-din Rumi and Attar Neishabouri.

 “Listen to the reed (flute), how it is complaining!

It is complaining about the separations:

 I want a heart that is torn, torn from separations,

so that I may explain the pain of this love.”

 (Listen to the flute” by Rumi, Translation by Mostafa Momen, Princeton University, NJ, USA)
