## Statement
In my print series called, passengers I represent scattered silhouette figurative forms made from the wood. Inside each figure, there are several detailed hatch lines with recognizable parts of the body interwoven with the wood grains.Each silhouette represent a mere appearance of individual within the several details and unknown secrets inside. The figurative characters represent the story of people, who are traveling from one place to another, they go together although their dreams, imaginations and desires are different. There is a dialogue, a whisper spread all over;

Mysterious journey,
“Whisper,”
Aim, love, desire.
“Renounce your love; Go on
(Pause)
I doubt,
“Should I Turn?
“Turn.”
A Unified sound:
Stay here
We are all passengers.
