In this workshop students discover the transformative power of music and poetry collaging on handmade paper. Through carefully selected classical compositions and guided exploration, Students experience new dimensions of emotional awareness and artistic expression. This innovative approach bridges the gap between sound and language, and visual art-making, allowing their inner poet to emerge naturally through musical inspiration.
