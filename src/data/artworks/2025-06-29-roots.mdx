## The Roots[^1]

I close my eyes
Searching, to make sense of the space; Inside and out
The dark but warm container of silence embraces me.
I sink inside, like a snail in its shell
And melt.
Quietly, softly I sink inside
(Pause)

Searching
Breath in, breath out

A wind blows over me,
Gentle, cold. I sink inside

Searching

A light shine in my shell
Pleasant, bright.

Still searching

I raise my head. My arms
Recall memories from a place;
I found my roots through my dream.

Still, I feel suspended,
fluttering between spaces inside and out!
