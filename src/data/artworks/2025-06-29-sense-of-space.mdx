## Statement 

This project consists of handmade lightweight paper made of cotton pulp mixed with recycled envelops and copies of family letters passed from generations, which I collected in my last visit to my hometown (Tehran, Iran). I used the family letters because, for me, they are invaluable objects that carry historical significance and at the same time function as umbilical cords keeping the bond between the family members. What I find fascinating about them is the ways in which they communicate a sense of liminality through personal stories of the emotional exchange, family bonds, and homesickness, while their physical fragility marks their own vulnerability to time.
