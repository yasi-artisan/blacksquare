## Statement

Shadow Facing the light” is a painting and video installation in 2015 which offers the experience of spatial transition and spiritual journey. Visual images compound of different mediums; line drawing figurative forms created from acrylic and water color paints, Video animation of self-portrait projected on Plexiglas plates compound of hatched dry points printmaking techniques and light installation. The suspended large painted imagery breaks the boundaries of two-dimensionality and flows into spaces.
