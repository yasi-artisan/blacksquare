This collaborative online workshop invites participants to reevaluate and revisit their understanding of ‘home’ and the emotional and mental associations tied to it. We’ve created a platform that weaves together diverse visual interpretations of ‘home’, fostering a sense of connection among people, regardless of their origin or current location. This project encourages communication through art, promoting dialogue in both visual and verbal forms. It was a collective effort to connect people and create a shared understanding of ‘home’ and belonging. (Colledge of Art Association Conference, 2021, Art Exchange)
