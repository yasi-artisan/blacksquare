## About me
Yasaman (Yasi) Moussavi is an interdisciplinary artist and educator whose research-based practice explores the intersection of displacement, precarity, and social status. As a Ph.D. candidate at the University of British Columbia (CA), she examines the complex narratives of migration and impermanence in contemporary society. Moussavi holds an MFA from Texas Tech University (USA), where she developed her expertise in papermaking and installation artâ€”practices that now form the foundation of her current work.

Through her artistic practice, she creates embodied experiences that invite viewers to contemplate the uncertainties of precarity. Her process deliberately employs ephemeral and recycled materials as metaphors for the transient experiences of displaced communities. By weaving together poetry and multilingual text with visual elements, her work explores the nuanced stories of displacement and the transitional phases of changing social status. Her work has been displayed and published in many national and international solo and group exhibitions.
