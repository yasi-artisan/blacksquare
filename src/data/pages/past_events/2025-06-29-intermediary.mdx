Opening August 16 at  Massy Arts gallery.

The exhibition is on view from August 16-September16.

The Massy Arts Gallery is located at 23 East Pender Street in Chinatown, Vancouver.
The gallery is open Tuesday to Saturday, 12 pm to 5pm.

 The following are excerpts from my interview about this body of work: 

> Architecture and language have always fascinated me. Basically, the former is spatial order, and the latter is mental organization. In the broader sense, architecture can be seen as a form of non-verbal communication, just as language can be seen as an expression of verbal communication. Yet, the two have a deeper connection. We live through language but experience within a space. As an expression of a form of life, architecture embodies the spatial experience of language. Understanding the correlation between the sensory experience and the structure in our embodied experience of a place is of particular interest to me.
